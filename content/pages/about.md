## What is Bun Blog?

Bun Blog is a **static site generator** built with [Bun](https://bun.sh/). This
means that you can add and edit content by editing local markdown files. Your
markdown files exist with your source files so they are versioned with git. By
doing `bun run index.ts` you run the build script which creates static html
files using your markdown content and settings.

Unlike other static site generators, Bun Blog is super **simple** and
**extensible**. The great defaults inspired by
[Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/) mean you can quickly make tiny, optimized
pages which work well on all devices. Unlike Bear Blog, all of Bun Blog's code
is **yours**. `index.ts` is optimized for modification. Make your blog work
exactly how you want.
